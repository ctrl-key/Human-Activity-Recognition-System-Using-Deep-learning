STEPS TO EXECUTE THE PROJECT.

step 1: Go to "https://colab.research.google.com/".

step 2: go to files and click "new notebook".

step 3: locate the "Human_Action_Recogntion_using_CNN_+_LSTM_ipynb_final.ipynb" file from the source code.

step 4: Run each code snipet sequentialy.

step 5: in the download youtube video section add your own youtube video line.
Note: Only add suitable video links with less duration.

Step 6: run the final code snippet "Perform Action Recognition on the Test Video" which will give you an output video
        predicting the action performed in the video.
